## Bundling and Exclusion in the Defined Contribution Plan Market

**Abstract** Employers work with recordkeepers to provide Defined Contribution (DC) plans for their employees. Most of the major recordkeepers are vertically integrated, including their own investment products in the plan menu. Recordkeepers effectively sell a bundle of two products: the recordkeeping service and the affiliated investment products. I show that in addition to the typical bundling pricing strategy, recordkeepers promote bundled sales through an exclusion strategy, requiring minimum revenue from a single client in order to induce the employers to choose plans with more affiliated options or more expensive options. As a result, small sponsors are excluded from the client pool of the major recordkeepers. Pooled employer plans, introduced in 2021 by The SECURE Act, can be an effective alternative for small sponsors to access major recordkeepers and improve plan participants’ welfare.


## Capital Flows, Corporate Financing, and Institutional Ownership of U.S. Equity Markets
with Alon Brac and Dorothy Lund

**Abstract**  We analyze the equilibrium relationship between equity flows, corporate financing decisions, and institutional ownership of U.S. public equity to better understand the sources of inflows allocated to asset managers and the dramatic growth in equity ownership of institutional asset managers over the past two decades. Contrary to current narrative, we find that ownership by the Big Three — Vanguard, State Street Global Advisors, and BlackRock— has leveled off in recent years. Evidence based on equity capital flows into the Big Three also undermines the conventional narrative of rapid and accelerating growth. We present a framework to understand how fund characteristics and corporate actions such as stock buybacks and equity issuances have combined to shape the evolution of institutional investor ownership, including that of the Big Three. Indeed, our analysis reveals that a substantial part of the growth of institutional investor ownership of U.S. capital markets can be attributed to these fund characteristics and corporate actions. Our evidence points to the origin of fund flows and why certain institutions win and lose in the contest for flows.

## Human Capital, Competition and Mobility in the Managerial Labor Market
with John Barry and Noah Lyman

We estimate a search model of managerial careers to quantify the relative importance of human capital accumulation (both general and firm-specific), managerial bargaining power, and imperfect labor market competition in shaping compensation and mobility in the market for US corporate executives. The composition of human capital is career-dependent and varies widely across managers:  over tenure, firm-specific capital is the greatest driver of wage growth, whereas over experience in the labor market, job search and competition dominate. Firm-specific capital can help explain the high rate of internal CEO hires and low observed cross-firm CEO mobility. We further show that labor market competition (relative to pure bargaining power) makes up the majority of realized CEO surplus capture, and that firm-specific human capital positively interacts with competition in determining CEOs' shares of rents because it raises the match-specific quality between the firm and manager.
